Understanding the role of genetics and epigenetic variation is important because it allows the possibility of personalized medicine. Approaches to studying genetic/epigenetic variation are highly statistical and probabilistic.

At Sheffield we are working on:

* Developing Bayesian statistical methods to incorporate functional genomic information into eQTL mapping.
* Novel Bayes factors for use in fine-mapping multi-factorial genetic diseases.
* Likelihood-free inference for problems involving cellular populations, particularly stem cells.
* Developing hidden Markov models to detect essential regions using bacterial transposon sequencing data.

Members working on these topics: Dr. Kevin Walters.
