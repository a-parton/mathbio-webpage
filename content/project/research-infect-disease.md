Understanding the emergence, spread and evolution of infectious diseases in natural and managed populations is a major challenge. Working closely with experimental biologists, we develop mathematical models describing the interactions of hosts and their parasites using ordinary differential equations. The main focus of our research is on how population-level processes drive evolutionary dynamics.

Key questions include:

* What host characteristics select for highly virulent rather than benign parasites?
* How do other community interactions affect the evolution of host defences to disease?
* When should we expect temporal fluctuations in host and parasite strains, and when long-term coexistence?

Members working on these topics: Dr. Alex Best.
