Ecological models and data present many challenging statistical problems. Research on this topic in Sheffield concentrates particularly on Bayesian computer-intensive statistical methods, in collaboration with statistical colleagues, especially through the [National Centre for Statistical Ecology](https://ncse.org.uk/), and with ecologists both in Sheffield and worldwide.

Examples of current interest include:

* Movement modelling and inference, using continuous-time stochastic models to interpret data from GPS and similar tracking methods, from individuals and from groups of animals.
* Statistical inference for ecosystem models, particularly size-spectrum models with marine applications through the [Marine Ecosystems Research Programme](http://www.marine-ecosystems.org.uk/).
* Statistical methods for complex systems such as individual-based models for which it is not possible to write down a likelihood function.
