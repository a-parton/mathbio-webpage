Understanding how animals develop has profound implications for our ability to engineer and repair tissues. Since Alan Turing's reaction-diffusion theory of morphogenesis in the 1950s, mathematical modelling has helped developmental biologists to understand the mechanisms and dynamics behind their observations. 

At Sheffield, in collaboration with experimentalists, we use mathematical modelling tackle the following key questions:

* How do signalling molecules provide positional information to cells in developing tissues? 
* How do mechanical forces shape developing tissues?
* How are these processes disrupted in developmental defects and in disease?

Members working on these topics: Dr. Alex Fletcher.
