Mathematical models of ecological systems are of fundamental importance for predicting and managing changes in the natural world.

At Sheffield, we are particularly interested in the following questions:

* Can we construct techniques to help predict the effects of future environmental change on the ability of animal populations to survive?
* How do complex systems of animal movements and interactions give rise to emergent population-level patterns?
* Can we predict where biological invasions are likely to occur and how can we control their spread?
* How can we infer the nature of animal interaction mechanisms, both with each other and their environment, from movement data?

We use a range of statistical, computational, and mathematical tools to address these questions, from information criteria to statistical mechanics to partial differential equations.
