# Postgraduates

We welcome enquiries from students interested in studying for a PhD in mathematical biology. We encourage anyone interested to read our research interests and make contact with the relevant member of staff. UK and EU students may be eligible for SoMaS funding, see [here](http://maths.dept.shef.ac.uk/maths/prospectivepg/research_degrees.html) for details. Formal applications must be made through Sheffield's online application form, available [here](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/apply/applying).

# Undergraduates

We currently offer the following undergraduate courses in mathematical biology:

## MAS377 - Mathematical Biology

This level 3 course provides an introduction to the mathematical modelling of the dynamics of biological populations. The emphasis is on deterministic models based on systems of differential equations that encode population birth and death rates. Examples are drawn from a range of different dynamic biological populations, from the species level down to the dynamics of molecular populations within cells.

To find out more contact the course lecturers, Prof Nick Monk (n.monk@shef.ac.uk) and Dr Alex Best (a.best@shef.ac.uk).

## MAS316/414 - Mathematical modelling of natural systems

Mathematical modelling enables insight in to a wide range of scientific problems. This level 3/4 module provides a practical introduction to techniques for modelling natural systems. Students learn how to construct, analyse and interpret mathematical models, using a combination of differential equations, scientific computing and mathematical reasoning. Students learn the art of mathematical modelling: translating a scientific problem into a mathematical model, identifying and using appropriate mathematical tools to analyse the model, and finally relating the significance of the mathematical results back to the original problem. Study systems are drawn from throughout the environmental and life sciences.

To find out more contact the course lecturer Dr Alex Best (a.best@shef.ac.uk).

## MMath and MSc Projects

Level 4 mathematics and statistics students have the opportunity to undertake a research project supervised by a member of staff. Project titles in mathematical biology are available each year for MAS406/407 (MMath) and we welcome enquiries from any students interested in undertaking a project with us. We encourage anyone interested to read our research interests and make contact with the relevant member of staff.
