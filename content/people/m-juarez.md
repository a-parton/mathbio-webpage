## Research interests

* Gene regulatory networks, panel and longitudinal data, reference priors.
* I am currently working on models for gene regulatory networks using short time series with replicated measurements, exploring ways of specifying priors that can accommodate correlations among the network coefficients. 
* I am also developing models for analysis and tracking of STORM superresolution imaging.
