## Research interests
I am currently working on mathematical models of planar polarity formation, investigating global polarity cues and feedback mechanisms. I test model predictions by carrying out experiments in developing Drosophila tissues. I have a wider interest in how cell polarity is maintained in migrating cells, its role in collective cell movement, and its role in the morphogenesis of three dimensional structures.
